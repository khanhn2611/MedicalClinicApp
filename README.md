## About the Project
  This web application is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly way for a health provider company to manage their clinics. With this application, patients can easily schedule appointments with their primary care physicians or specialists. Patients can view available time slots and schedule appointments at their convenience. The web application also provides reminders via email to help patients keep track of their upcoming appointments.

In addition, this web application includes portals for doctors/specialists and nurses to manage their schedules, view patient information, create reports, create prescriptions, and update appointment status. The doctor portal allows doctors to view their upcoming appointments, review patient histories, prescribe treatments, and update appointment status. The nurse portal provides similar functionality, allowing them to manage their schedules, create reports for patients during an appointment, and assist doctors in providing the best care possible.

Furthermore, administrators have access to a portal to manage their employees and review clinic performance through detailed reports. This provides valuable insights into the clinic's operations and helps in making informed business decisions.

The web application also includes robust user authentication, ensuring that all users have secure access to the application. Patients are required to create an account, while doctors and nurses are assigned accounts created by administrators. This helps to maintain the confidentiality and security of patient information.

Overall, this web application provides a comprehensive solution for health provider companies to manage their clinics, streamline their operations, and improve the patient experience.
